This is a story about college student(s). It was 7 in the morning, phone started ringing, signaling the urge to wake up.
He took a quick wash and then packed up notes for two classes he cannot miss. 
Walking out of his apartment, the sky was blue and sun shone bright.
	Then the sun began to change colors rapidly, flashing red, blue, green and a variety of other colors. This miraculous event was incredible to witness. Unfortunately, he was already late for class. He readjusted his bag and hurried along his regular path. He made and effort to avoid all of the onloookers gazing at the sun and wondered if this strange occurence would lead to class getting cancelled. He doutbed it because he knew his professor was adamant on never missing a single moment of class. Before his mind had began to wonder too far off course he had arrived at his lecture hall.
	As he burst through the doors, expecting plenty of judgmental stares, he found the classroom empty and dark. He could not believe it! He checked his email immediately, beaming with excitment as he looked for the "class is cancelled" email. before he could enter his password, he realized it was Thursday, a day in which this class did not meet.
	The college students name was McLovin. After realizing that his class did not meet on Thursday, McLovin decided it was time to change his major to finger painting. McLovin was determined to be the best finger painter that ever lived. Nothing could stop him. Day after day, night after night, rain or shine, McLovin was there, finger painting with a burning passion in his heart and a ambitious goal in his mind. He finger painted harder than any finger painter ever had. 
The End
